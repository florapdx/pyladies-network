# Web 101 part 1 

## Introduction

The goal of today is to understand the components that go into building a web application.

We thought it would be a good idea to understand something about networking communicaiton and the interne before we go into that since this is a part of the communication between all of the pieces. 

A web application is a really fancy complex way to get data from around the internet onto your screen, usually (but not always) using a browser. In a really simple situation, the browser (which is a client) is making requests to a web server, recieving a response, and then displaying it. 

## Simple server client relationship. 

A server is a process that is listening for requests and has some kind of logic to create and return a response.
 
A client communicated with a server by sending requests and receiving responses.

Some examples of clients are browsers, curl command in terminal, mobile app.

Because there are a lot of varienty in servers, clients, and the hardware and operating systems they run on, we have protocols to help make sure they're communicating consistently.

Flesh out: Different protocols and protocol layers

Talk about IP, and addresses, what the transport layer is, and mention we'll com back to it later. 

## Building clients and servers with Python
We're going to start by building a simple server and client with python and then we will use them to send each other requests and responses

### Go through echo_server.py and echo_client.py

why we need socket, sys, and argparse

The socket library unsurprisingly allows us to create sockets to communicate over. It gives Python access to the system's socket interface. A socket is the part of a program where the communication happens. More about socketsâ€¦ 

sys are argparse help us build the command line options. 

we need an address and port so that the client and server can communicate. And address corresponse to a particular device, and ports allow a device to control what traffic gets to them and then different processes can use different ports.

### Have everyone start up server script

```
$ python echo_server.py --port=9900
```
Then open another terminal and run the client

```
$ python echo_server.py --port=9900
```

### Questions to discuss
* Did it work?
* Why did we have to use two terminal windows?
* What would happen if the ports didn't match? 

### Continue, editing the scripts
Give everyone a chance to modify their server so that it does some thing more interesting. 
Try to get people making requests to other people's servers. 


## HTTP Protocol
Talk about http

* headers
* user agent
* http status codes

## Use cURL and requests module to view http responses



## Build HTTP server and client with Python

Now we're a lot closer to what web applications do, but most of them are much much much more complex. We'll talk about that second half, but before we do that, let's do a quick chat about transport of info and internet protocol, on the transport/network layer

## Packets, IP, etc
Talk about packets get around the internet
Do some demos, playing around with Traceroute and wireshark
